An #Blockchain based ecommerce application where user can buy of Sell NFT's i.e. Non Fungible Tokens  . NFT are a unique hashed Stings that can not be replaced kind of "one-of-a-Kind Treading Card" . NFTs really became technically possible when the Ethereum blockchain added support for them as part of a new standard. Of course, one of the first uses was a game called CryptoKitties that allowed users to trade and sell virtual kittens. 


#This Project is Build on Ethereum with Polygon
Tech Stack Used Includes :-> Polygon, Next.js, Tailwind, Solidity, Hardhat, Ethers.js, and IPFS
->Hardhat is a library that provides Ethereum development environment .
->Solidity is udes for coading smart Contracts for the Blockchain 
->IPFS is the decentralized Storege System 
->Talwind is a CSS Library used for better UI building 
->Ether.JS is a library aims to be a complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem. 
->Polygon library provides better user experience  , ETH Compatibility, Developer Experience Modularity etc.

 ERC-721is a that standard guarantees that NFTs execute the intended purpose, and, unlike ERC-20, it also maintains the token's uniqueness and maintains rigorous control over information validity at all stages of transmission.
 
 How does an NFT marketplace work?

The user registers for the platform, which they may do using their existing login credentials.

They will need to create a suitable crypto wallet in order to store the tokens.

The user may establish an NFT and configure the auction settings using the protocol and keeping their asset in mind. When all of this is completed, the collection will be placed for sale.

The platform is in charge of regulating the products, and the posted item appears on a sales list that potential purchasers may peruse.

Buyers submit bids in the auction, and sellers are notified of the highest offers.

The platform handles the transfer of tokens and cash using smart contracts, making the entire process simple and straightforward.
The platform gets compensated for enabling the transfer.

As you may expect, the platform's earnings are derived through commissions. That might also be a sponsor listing system, in which those that pay the platform get their products featured first. With so many potential profit opportunities available, it's understandable that an ambitious crypto entrepreneur would want to build a firm around NFT marketplaces.


# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
